To them and to everyone else who participated, thank you <strong>so much</strong> for your efforts. Every answer helps, and over the course of this contributor weekend, these amazing volunteers responded to <strong>800 support threads</strong>.

We emphasize that WordCamps are locally-organized events, not something that the central <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community">community team</a> plans from afar.</p>\n<p>This has been successful in many areas &#8212; there are currently 241 meetup groups on our meetup.com chapter program! In some regions, though, enthusiastic volunteers have had more of a challenge getting things started. Because of this, we&#8217;re going to try an experiment this year called the WordCamp Incubator.</p>\n<p>The intention of the incubator program is to help spread WordPress to underserved areas through providing more significant organizing support for a first event. In practical terms, this experiment means we&#8217;ll be choosing three cities in 2016 where there is not an active WordPress community &#8212; but where it seems like there is a lot of potential and where there are some people excited to become organizers &#8212; and will help to organize their first WordCamp. These WordCamps will be small, one-day, one-track events geared toward the goal of generating interest and getting people involved in creating an ongoing local community.*</p>\n<p>So, where should we do these three events?  If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven&#8217;t been able to get a meetup group going, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next week, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the  cities chosen by the end of March.</p>\n<p>To apply, <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-application">fill in the application</a> by February 26, 2016. You don&#8217;t need to have any specific information handy, it&#8217;s just a form to let us know you&#8217;re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don&#8217;t want to be the main organizer, but for this experiment  we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.</p>\n<p>Thanks, and good luck!</p>\n<p><em><strong>* </strong>For the record, that describes the ideal first WordCamp even if you have an active meetup &#8212; there&#8217;s no need to wait until your group is big enough to support a large multi-day event, and small events are a lot of fun because everyone has a chance to be involved and get to know most of the other attendees.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:36:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 4.4.2 Security and Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/wordpress-4-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Feb 2016 17:57:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4065";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:375:"WordPress 4.4.2 is now available.

Working together in person is really fun, so we highly recommend trying to get some folks together if you&#8217;re able, but if that&#8217;s not possible you can still connect to other participants online. Either way, this is a great way to give back to the WordPress project and have some fun helping people at the same time.</p>\n<p>Interested? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/20-questions/">Get the details on how to participate</a>.</p>\n<p>Hope to see you next weekend!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:39:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 4.4.1 Security and Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/01/wordpress-4-4-1-security-and-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Jan 2016 20:07:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4041";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:376:"WordPress 4.4.1 is now available.

Different combinations can produce wildly different designs. What if you could save a preview of customizations before going live with it? This is the idea behind the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/" target="_blank">Customize Snapshots</a> plugin from Weston Ruter, Derek Herman, and the team at <a href="https://xwp.co/" target="_blank">XWP</a>.</p>\n<p>Customize Snapshots lets you draft and preview customizer states that can be shared via a private URL that the plugin generates. Users who are not authenticated can preview snapshots on the frontend without loading the customizer. Authenticated users will be able to load the snapshot inside the customizer to make further edits or publish the draft.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/customize-snapshot.gif"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/customize-snapshot.gif?resize=1025%2C525" alt="customize-snapshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52864" /></a></p>\n<p>You may not be able to see it in the demo above, but snapshots can be saved with a scope of full or dirty, according to the plugin details page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full:</strong> will playback all the settings during preview [changeset]</li>\n<li><strong>Dirty:</strong> will only playback the ones that were marked dirty when the snapshot was taken [snapshot]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Snapshots was written as a feature plugin to implement a key feature that the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/26/customizer-transactions-proposal/" target="_blank">Customizer Transactions proposal</a> will make possible,&#8221; Weston Ruter said. Ruter is the Technology Director at XWP and a co-maintainer of WordPress&#8217; core customizer component. He said the plugin was also developed specifically for a client&#8217;s project requirements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Customize Snapshots stores the Customizer state in a custom post type,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can access the frontend of the site with the UUID for the snapshot added as a URL parameter to load the site with that Customizer state applied. So this makes it possible to preview Customizer changes on other devices entirely.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Coming Soon: Schedule Customizier Changes to Go Live at a Future Date</h3>\n<p>WordPress core lacks the ability to schedule out changes to content that has already been published. The only option for editing published posts is to push changes live. This is also the same for the customizer, but the XWP team is aiming to add scheduling to Customize Snapshots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea here, though not implemented yet in the feature plugin, is that you could also schedule a snapshot (aka transaction) to go live at a certain time,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;So you could bundle up a bunch of changes in the Customizer and &#8216;Save &amp; Publish&#8217; at a scheduled time, like Sunday at midnight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With transactions added to the customizer, users could build up a large &#8216;changeset&#8217; as a draft, including things like building new pages, adding a collection of widgets, and updating menu items. The entire set of changes can then be scheduled to go live at the same time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other side of that coin, it allows for there to be revision history for changes made in the Customizer,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;And this will work seamlessly with the <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts" target="_blank">Customize Posts</a> feature plugin &#8211; the goal being to let the author do as much as possible during a Customizer session, for all changes to be previewed together, submitted for review and iteration, and staged for publishing at some point in time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter said he sees Customize Snapshots as another take on the common desire to build out content on a staging environment, preview changes, and then promote those changes to production.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a hard problem to solve, and lots of plugins are available with solutions, like WP-CFM, Ramp, and others,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But in the Customizer it&#8217;s something you can get for free because of its model, and you don&#8217;t need multiple environments. You just need to indicate which snapshot/transaction state you want to preview.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you previously had a difficult time grasping the technical details of Ruter&#8217;s <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/26/customizer-transactions-proposal/" target="_blank">customizer transactions proposal</a>, the Customize Snapshots plugin is a perfect example of the kind of functionality that transactions would enable. The feature plugin is an adaptation of his proposed changes that implement the more fundamental “transactions” construct.</p>\n<p>Customize Snapshots adds to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/xwp/#content-plugins" target="_blank">XWP&#8217;s collection of plugins</a> that extend the customizer in innovative ways and intersect with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/23/outlining-a-possible-roadmap-for-the-customizer/" target="_blank">the framework&#8217;s long-term roadmap</a>. Occasionally, this will also tie into client work, as with the case of Customize Snapshots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We try to propose Customizer solutions for client projects as a way to fund Customizer advances, but we also believe in the Customizer and would be working on it regardless,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/" target="_blank">Customize Snapshots</a> makes the customizer a more collaborative environment within WordPress. If you need to make a large number of changes and share a preview with others, this plugin will help you do that. The ability to see snapshots in the admin and schedule changes will make it even more useful in the future.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 20:52:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: Get Your Widgets Ready for WordPress 4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52812";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://wptavern.com/get-your-widgets-ready-for-wordpress-4-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2255:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/testing.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/testing.jpg?resize=960%2C474" alt="testing" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46092" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress 4.5 is right around the corner with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/03/wordpress-4-5-release-candidate/" target="_blank">first release candidate</a> now available for download.

Plugin and theme authors who want to be on the cutting edge of the customizer&#8217;s new capabilities will want to review Weston Ruter&#8217;s post on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/" target="_blank">Implementing Selective Refresh Support for Widgets</a>. All of the default WordPress themes and core widgets will ship with selective refresh in 4.5, but the feature is opt-in for plugins and themes.</p>\n<p>For most themes with standard sidebars, adding selective refresh is as simple as including one line to declare theme support:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">add_theme_support( ''customize-selective-refresh-widgets'' );</pre>\n<p>Adding support for widgets is a bit more involved, depending on whether the widget uses JavaScript for initialization. Ruter&#8217;s post includes a tutorial for how to add selective refresh in either scenario. The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-5-project-schedule/" target="_blank">target release date for 4.5</a> is April 12, 2016, so plugin and theme developers still have three weeks to add support.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 16:18:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: Versions of WP-CLI Prior to 0.23.0 Are Incompatible with WordPress 4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52830";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://wptavern.com/versions-of-wp-cli-prior-to-0-23-0-are-incompatible-with-wordpress-4-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1858:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/restful-wp-cli.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49286" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/restful-wp-cli.png?resize=1025%2C459" alt="restful-wp-cli" /></a>Daniel Bachhuber, maintainer of <a href="http://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI</a>, a popular command line interface utility for managing WordPress sites, <a href="http://wp-cli.org/blog/version-0.23.0.html">has released</a> version 0.23.0.

Since WordPress itself is already a magnet for spam signups and comments, BuddyPress is subject to the same and then some. With an ordinary WordPress site you can block most of it fairly well, but with BuddyPress you often have to wade through signups to verify that real humans aren&#8217;t getting blocked.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to cut down on the avalanche of unwanted signups is to restrict them by email domain. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rsed/" target="_blank">BP Restrict Signup by Email Domain</a> is a plugin that allows you to whitelist an email domain or set of domains that will be required for registration on the site. You can also set an error message and create a custom message to appear on the registration page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-address-restrictions.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-address-restrictions.png?resize=566%2C862" alt="email-address-restrictions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52791" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin was created by BuddyPress contributing developer Ray Hoh for the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">CUNY Academic Commons</a>. It&#8217;s part of a suite of plugins recommended by the <a href="http://commonsinabox.org/" target="_blank">Commons In A Box (CBOX)</a> free software project. The university uses the plugin to ensure that anyone signing up to the Academic Commons will have a CUNY email address. You can see it in action on the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/register/" target="_blank">registration page</a>.</p>\n<p>BP Restrict Signup by Email Domain works on both single site and multisite installations of WordPress. It has been tested with the latest version of BuddyPress (2.5) but should also be compatible back to version 1.6.</p>\n<p>Not every social site can afford to limit email domains, but this plugin works well for academic sites, nonprofit or other types of organizations, or any community that excludes all but a few set email domains. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rsed/" target="_blank">BP Restrict Signup by Email Domain</a> is open source on WordPress.org and is actively maintained for use on CUNY.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 23:09:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: Frederick Townes Confirms W3 Total Cache is Not Abandoned";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52766";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://wptavern.com/frederick-townes-confirms-w3-total-cache-is-not-abandoned";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7219:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> is a free, caching WordPress plugin created by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/fredericktownes/">Frederick Townes</a> that&#8217;s active on more than one million sites.

Out of 44 reports, 34 people say W3 Total Cache 0.9.4.1 doesn&#8217;t work with WordPress 4.4.2.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/W3TCBroken.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-52769" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/W3TCBroken.png?resize=884%2C626" alt="W3 Total Cache Not Compatible With WordPress 4.4.2" /></a>W3 Total Cache Not Compatible With WordPress 4.4.2\n<p>The plugin was recently updated with the <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1375883/w3-total-cache">only change</a> being the readme.txt file which states it has been tested up to WordPress 4.5. A cursory glance at the support forums indicates <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-come-the-version-0941-now-says-updated-on-mar-21">some users</a> are <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatible-up-to-45-but-no-update-since-9-months-ago">not pleased</a> with the simple update.</p>\n<h2>A Rocky Year</h2>\n<p>In 2015, a disgruntled customer who purchased services from <a href="http://www.w3-edge.com/">W3 Edge</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2r7un1/my_experience_with_what_its_like_with_w3_total/">described their negative experience</a> in a post on the WordPress subreddit. The complaints include, a lack of communication, not receiving purchased services, and project delays. Mike McAlister, of <a href="https://arraythemes.com/">Array Themes</a>, told the Tavern about his experience with W3 Edge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2014, I signed up for the premium version of W3 Total Cache to unlock some of the advanced caching features. The email confirmation said that the license would auto-renew unless cancelled, so I contacted them right away with my request to cancel the auto-renewal. I didn&#8217;t hear anything back and wrongly assumed this was taken care of.</p>\n<p>Fast forward one year and I get an email out of nowhere that my W3 license had been renewed. I immediately contacted W3 with details of my order and politely requested a solution, but never heard a response.</p>\n<p>I wrote a total of four emails and several tweets directed at W3 Edge and its founder, Frederick Townes, with not a single response throughout the ordeal. Like many others, I had to resort to calling the bank and filing a dispute to get my money back, which dragged the issue out for several months.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the end of the Reddit thread, W3 Edge <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2r7un1/my_experience_with_what_its_like_with_w3_total/cqag9sw">responded to the criticism</a> and admitted that the company let users down with its lack of engagement. It also admitted to having a small team and the challenges involved with its support model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the largest lessons learned is that there&#8217;s a lot to get right especially with a small team,&#8221; W3 Edge said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made some changes to the team recently and we&#8217;re working to rectify experiences like the ones noted here. Since it’s the customer experience that matters and not intentions, I apologize for the negative experiences. Our mission remains to enable independent publishers with great software and solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>W3 Total Cache Status Update</h2>\n<p>The company&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/w3edge/with_replies?lang=en">official Twitter account</a> has been inactive since April of 2015 and the <a href="https://www.w3-edge.com/weblog/">last post published</a> on its blog was 10 months ago. Combined with the lack of plugin updates, it&#8217;s understandable why customers and users are concerned with the plugin&#8217;s status.</p>\n<p>Frederick Townes, founder of W3 Edge, issued the following statement to the Tavern.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since the last update, development and other operations have been ongoing. There have been several hundred bug fixes based on user feedback, more than 100 improvements and numerous major improvements. We’ve added tens of thousands of unit tests for the various bugs and improvements in an attempt to allow us to release more updates faster in the future.</p>\n<p>We’re also working on a new services and support model, which is more exclusive in an attempt to reduce the volume of service requests and misaligned customer / subscriber expectations.</p>\n<p>Our goal is unchanged, to create easy ways for publishers and developers to increase WordPress performance and tune user-experience in self-hosted environments. As we work towards leaving beta and moving towards a 1.0 release (and making our GitHub repository public rather than private) our goal is to offer hosted services that use automation to simplify the performance optimization process in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I spoke to Townes for an hour on Skype and he comes across as a sincere, concerned business owner who is struggling to find a system that works for the amount of support volume he and his team are dealing with. I asked what keeps him motivated to continue working on W3 Total Cache, &#8220;I love solving complex problems which is what W3 Total Cache does,&#8221; Townes replied.</p>\n<p>I can only imagine how heavy the burdens are maintaining a free plugin that&#8217;s active on more than a million sites. Joost de Valk, founder of <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast.com</a>, and lead developer of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO</a>, a plugin active on more than one million sites shared some of the <a href="https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-3-0-release-a-recap/">lessons he learned</a> after users experienced issues upgrading to 3.0.</p>\n<h2>Have The Changes Worked?</h2>\n<p>While researching for this article, I requested feedback from thousands of people to learn what recent customers are experiencing with the company but no one responded. This can mean any number of things but it&#8217;s difficult to determine whether the changes mentioned in the Reddit thread have improved the situation without getting feedback from recent customers.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve recently purchased services from W3 Edge, please share your experience with us in the comments.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 20:42:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: GitHub Issue and Pull Request Templates: Choose Your Own Adventure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52746";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"http://wptavern.com/github-issue-and-pull-request-templates-choose-your-own-adventure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2633:"<p>Last month GitHub <a href="http://wptavern.com/github-introduces-issue-and-pull-request-templates" target="_blank">introduced issue and pull request templates</a> in response to the <a href="http://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management" target="_blank">&#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter of complaints</a> from open source project maintainers.

At every step you make selections that will help structure the final templates.

Is it user friendly? About as friendly as a mad hatter. Does the writing make sense? Absolutely not. Did I get it from idea to shipping in 3 days?

In addition to ironing out the logistics, contributors must also take into account what might be lost or gained in the GitHub approach to problem solving. The GitHub pull request collaboration style is markedly different than the lengthy discussions that happen on WordPress Trac.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, WordPress contributors who use GitHub as part of daily life are eager to see progress on an official pipeline for pull requests. In the meantime, Ryan McCue has just launched a utility that allows contributors to submit pull requests to core. <a href="https://rmccue.io/patch/" target="_blank">GitHub-to-Patch</a> is a proof-of-concept that provides an easy way to submit a pull request as a patch.</p>\n<p>The process that McCue outlines in his <a href="http://journal.rmccue.io/367/patch-wordpress-via-github/" target="_blank">post</a> involves submitting a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress/WordPress repo</a>, selecting the request via the utility, and associating the request with the corresponding ticket number. He also advises heading back to the ticket to leave a comment about the patch you added.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-to-patch-step-1.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-to-patch-step-1.png?resize=1025%2C703" alt="github-to-patch-step-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52726" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Internally, the utility uses GitHub’s API to get a patch format of the pull request, then uses Trac’s XML-RPC API to upload,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;This requires your WordPress.org credentials, and because of cross-origin policy, also requires an intermediary server. I hope to fix this in the future, either by integrating the tool into Trac itself, or by using OAuth with WordPress.org.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McCue clarified on Twitter that his utility is not meant to be a final solution to WordPress/GitHub interactions but rather a stop-gap measure until a better solution is available. He <a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue/status/712143679780200448" target="_blank">referenced</a> Weston Ruter&#8217;s approach that <a href="https://make.xwp.co/2015/12/05/streamlining-contributions-to-wordpress-core-via-github/" target="_blank">uses Travis CI to handle uploading patches from trusted pull requests to Trac</a> as one of the more elegant examples in the works.</p>\n<p>For those with no SVN experience, GitHub-to-Patch significantly lowers the barrier to entry for contributing to core. If you don&#8217;t want to use the <a href="https://rmccue.io/patch/" target="_blank">utility</a> on McCue&#8217;s server, the code is available on GitHub and can be installed on your own server.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 18:34:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WordPress Adopts Accessibility Coding Standards for All New and Updated Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52690";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3221:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/paper-1.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/paper-1.jpg?resize=960%2C501" alt="photo credit: Startup Stock Photos" class="size-full wp-image-52706" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/L2KBJB91D6">Startup Stock Photos</a>\n<p>The Accessibility Team announced today that the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/" target="_blank">WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards</a> have been approved for the core handbook. The team <a href="http://wptavern.com/your-chance-to-give-feedback-on-wordpress-accessibility-coding-standards" target="_blank">sought feedback on the draft of the guidelines</a> earlier this year and, after a few revisions, the coding standards are out of draft status.</p>\n<p>Contributors will now be required to meet these guidelines in order to have their code merged into core:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 guidelines</a> at level AA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Level AA, according to accessibility team member Rian Rietveld, includes guidelines used as a reference for a legal standard in many countries. WordPress&#8217; new accessibility coding standards cover five key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML Semantics</li>\n<li>Color Contrast</li>\n<li>Keyboard Accessibility</li>\n<li>Images and Icons</li>\n<li>Labeling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The default Twenty Sixteen theme is already compliant with WCAG 2 AA and more <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/" target="_blank">accessibility-ready themes</a> are tagged in the official directory. At this time, themes and plugins hosted on WordPress.org are not required to meet these guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a dedicated principle that WordPress needs to meet a certain level of accessibility standards is incredibly powerful,&#8221; contributor Joe Dolson said in a reaction on his <a href="https://www.joedolson.com/2016/03/wordpress-goes-wcag-mean/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since it doesn’t change the fact that the WordPress Accessibility team consists of a relatively small group of part-time volunteers, we have to realistically acknowledge that we won’t catch everything.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But that still leaves us with an overall arc that leads to a future with a more accessible WordPress, and that’s an unmistakable win for accessibility,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Vocal accessibility advocates have been <a href="http://wptavern.com/your-chance-to-give-feedback-on-wordpress-accessibility-coding-standards" target="_blank">calling for WordPress to adopt a set of standards</a> and these new guidelines demonstrate the project&#8217;s commitment to serving those with a disability.

The security measure will help combat increasing attempts on the host&#8217;s user portal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we grow, almost everything about the company changes, and security is one of them,&#8221; said WP Engine founder Jason Cohen. &#8220;For example, we see things like fraudulent accounts and account impersonation/phishing, and other things which didn’t appear often when we were smaller and less of a target.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Adding 2FA is part of a larger plan for improved security that the company began last year when it hired Eric Murphy as its new security director.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve had a cross-departmental internal security group of about a dozen people for a few years now, but in 2015 we decided we needed even more leadership in that area,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hired Eric last year, in fact before the December security incident, so in hindsight that was excellent timing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Murphy is now overseeing the technical aspects of security, like firewalls and VPNs, as well as the social engineering and training aimed at protecting customer account access.</p>\n<p>After the December breach where <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-security-breach-customer-credentials-exposed" target="_blank">customer credentials were exposed</a>, WP Engine began moving its customers off of Linode&#8217;s cloud infrastructure. Cohen confirmed that thousands of customers have been moved and that no new customers have been added to Linode.</p>\n<h3>The Challenges of Implementing 2FA</h3>\n<p>Although providing 2FA for accounts is a security best practice, Cohen said that it would not have prevented the December breach, as the entry point was with Linode. Regardless, WP Engine customers have been requesting 2FA support for the user portal for years. When asked why it took the company so long to implement it, Cohen identified a few of the technical challenges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the challenges was in identity recovery,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can’t use email as a way to recover from a lost phone, because then the email address becomes a &#8216;single factor,&#8217; i.e. you can use it to recover your password as well as your phone aspect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, nowadays with the advent of Google Authenticator and other apps, plus people’s general awareness of how to use things like scratch codes, we felt it was now not going to be hard for people to use,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>When it comes to protecting WordPress, WP Engine customers have always been able to use a plugin to add 2FA. Cohen said that the company is investigating a solution to make it more convenient for customers who manage multiple accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Suppose you manage 50 WP sites and you want 2FA,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So do you configure 2FA on every site and have 50 entries in your Google Authenticator App? That stinks!</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, something better would be a SSO system somewhere, have 2FA on <em>that</em>, and then use that to get into WordPress,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another way would be to use OAuth, e.g. use Google OAuth on WP, and indeed for customers who already use Google Apps, we do recommend that method. Another method might be that our own User Portal be an OAuth provider.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a host of solutions already available, Cohen said they are also considering simply pointing customers to a list of recommendations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if we do our own, we’d always support the other methods,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The idea isn’t to box anyone into a single method.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WP Engine Plans to Add Opt-In PHP 7 Support in 2016</h3>\n<p>WP Engine is currently <a href="https://wpengine.com/blog/php-7-the-way-of-the-future/" target="_blank">working on a PHP 7 implementation</a> for all customers. In December, the company tested 25 concurrent users over 5 minutes across 10 randomly selected URLs — run against a basic WordPress (4.3.1) install on its Mercury Vagrant configuration. The results showed that PHP 7 handles the raw hits 2.6x faster than PHP 5.5.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-engine-testing.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52674" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-engine-testing.png?resize=1025%2C709" alt="wp-engine-testing" /></a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, customers who are eager to see WP Engine upgrade to PHP 7 across the board will be waiting for the rest of the WordPress ecosystem to catch up. As an alternative, the company is looking at the possibility of making PHP 7 an opt-in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have PHP7 running on some machines,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;But it’s actually amazing how few WP sites in the field are compatible. We’re finding that it&#8217;s less than 20%. There will need to be an opt-in for that reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WordPress core is compatible with PHP 7, the vast majority of WordPress plugins and themes are not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even WooCommerce doesn’t completely work with it,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;Many big, popular plugins are not yet compatible. With PHP v5.5 there was some of that, but this is much more. Of course PHP7 is the future so it’s inevitable, but it’s going to take more time than some other PHP releases did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said the best case scenario would be for customers to choose PHP 7 on an install-by-install basis and change at any time.

This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Human Made Hires Siobhan McKeown</h2>\n<p>Development firm, Human Made Ltd., <a href="https://hmn.md/2016/03/17/siobhan-mckeown-joins-human-made/">announced</a> that it has hired Siobhan McKeown as their events director. Human Made worked closely with McKeown who helped organize and run <a href="https://feelingrestful.com">A Day of REST</a>, a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API. According to the post, McKeown&#8217;s role is to expand the company&#8217;s events, including the Day of Rest conference.</p>\n<h2>WordPress is the Light in a Sea of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Raghavendra Satish Peri from India, who discovered at the age of 14 that he was 80% blind, <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/finding-hope-darkness/">describes how WordPress</a> became a shining light in a sea of darkness.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress has changed the way I see my life, today I am a full time <a href="http://www.digitala11y.com">Digital Accessibility Consultant</a> &amp; I build most of my code examples on WP. This is helping me grow professionally &amp; personally each day. I am financially independent, travel around the world, attend &amp; speak at conferences/meet-ups, fought depression with my writing, wrote a bucket list &amp; am actively pursuing it. All this would have not been possible with the power of publishing &amp; WP has simplified it for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the post, Satish Peri says he has two wishes. The first is to attend WordCamp US and meet Matt Mullenweg. The second is to see every part of WordPress core be accessible. While the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/">WordPress accessibility team</a> is working on his second wish, how can we as a community grant the first?</p>\n<h2>WordPress&#8217; Greatest Threat Isn&#8217;t a CMS</h2>\n<p>Chris Wallace explains why the <a href="http://chriswallace.org/the-biggest-threat-to-wordpress-isnt-another-cms/">greatest threat to WordPress</a> isn&#8217;t a competing CMS, but the people who criticize it in a rude and disrespectful way.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But the biggest threat to WordPress right now is not a CMS. Heck, it’s not even a technology challenge or an issue with legacy code. The biggest threat to WordPress is people in the community who voice opinions in a rude and disrespectful way, echoing a deep lack of appreciation for the contributors and project leaders simply trying to make WordPress better within the framework of being used on 25% of the web <em>with a desire to continue increasing that number</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I tried to explain <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-not-to-communicate-grievances-with-wordpress">how to be helpful</a> when criticizing WordPress last year, but I&#8217;m not sure I made an impact. I know from experience that encountering a constant barrage of criticism is unhealthy and can lead to burnout. The same holds true for those who are committed to improving WordPress on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that things need to be sugarcoated, it&#8217;s that criticism should be given in an actionable way to make things better for all involved. It&#8217;s also about civil discourse and treating others with respect.</p>\n<p>The final part of Wallace&#8217;s post is great advice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let’s all take a few minutes to be grateful for the opportunity to make a living off the hard work of thousands of other people who donated their time and code to build something that has made a huge impact on the Internet and in people’s actual lives.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Matt Mullenweg on The Changelog Podcast</h2>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg appeared on <a href="https://changelog.com/197/">The Changelog podcast</a> to discuss the future of WordPress and how Calypso fits in. It&#8217;s a great show as the duo dive deep into the role JavaScript plays in the future of WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Developing a WordPress Plugin That Uses Service APIs</h2>\n<p>Smashing Magazine <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/making-a-wordpress-plugin-that-uses-service-apis/">published a great guide</a> that explains how to create a plugin that taps into third-party service APIs.</p>\n<h2>Adopting Plugins is Life Changing for Some</h2>\n<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/us/david-gewirtz/">David Gewirtz</a>, who writes for ZDNet, describes how <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-year-later-what-happens-when-you-adopt-an-open-source-project/">adopting 10 WordPress plugins changed his life</a>. It&#8217;s one of the coolest stories I&#8217;ve read on the use of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org">&#8220;Adopt-Me&#8221; tag</a> in the WordPress plugin directory. One of the best parts of the story is when Gewirtz explains what happened when he adopted a plugin with more than 10K active installs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seamless Donations had more than 10,000 active users on the day I adopted it. I expected my workload would be roughly the same as for the widget. I&#8217;d make a few security fixes as they came along and tweaks for compatibility.</p>\n<p>I was wrong.</p>\n<p>I also expected the users to be seasoned webmasters. After all, if you&#8217;re installing an open source project on your server, you&#8217;re obviously going to be experienced with Linux and PHP and all the rest, right? Right?</p>\n<p>Oh, how wrong I was.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Definitely give this a read if you&#8217;re thinking about adopting a popular plugin.</p>\n<h2>Warm Weather Wapuu</h2>\n<p>As a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project. Since the first day of Spring in the US is Sunday, March 20th, I decided to feature the Wapuu family from WordCamp Miami. Each member of the family except for the basketball one, is a reminder that warmer weather is on the way!</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcmia?src=hash">#wcmia</a> Wapuu family. <a href="http://t.co/U2Ao9Yh0qN">pic.twitter.com/U2Ao9Yh0qN</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp Miami (@wordcampmiami) <a href="https://twitter.com/wordcampmiami/status/606179756472692736">June 3, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for issue five.

James writes about marketing, digital design, entrepreneurship, and technology. He has gained most of his experience from running a variety of his own businesses for more than a decade.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On January 12, 2016, the W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) released its first public working draft of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-webmention-20160112/" target="_blank">Webmentions</a>, but the announcement didn’t feel new. In fact, Webmentions have been around since IndieWebCamp created them in 2013, and <a href="https://www.toptal.com/wordpress" target="_blank">top WordPress developers</a> are already using a Webmentions plugin to utilize the tool.</p>\n<p>Yet, for those who use WordPress, Webmentions seemed like a retread of WordPress’ Pingback system from the early 2000s, which featured a similar concept.</p>\n<p>The Pingback system was invented in 2002 by Stuart Langridge, and in essence, it allowed pieces that were published on different WordPress sites to talk to each other. This is perhaps best explained by walking through an example scenario:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Website A posts a new entry on its blog.</li>\n<li>Website B responds to that blog post with its own post and links to the post on Website A.</li>\n<li>The Pingback system then notifies Website A that Website B wrote about and linked to its blog post.</li>\n<li>Website A then verifies the content and link on Website B. If it is not spam, Website A will post a comment on the original blog post linking to Website B’s post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s important to note a few things about the Pingback system. First, it is exclusively for WordPress sites, and both sites have to enable Pingback for it to work. Second, the whole Pingback system is automated, streamlining the process of trackbacks, which is the manual equivalent of the automated Pingback.</p>\n<p>Yet despite its perks, <a href="http://wptavern.com/its-time-for-xml-rpc-in-wordpress-to-hit-the-road" target="_blank">Pingback system usage</a> declined after the automatic system was taken advantage of by spammers.</p>\n<p>The issue of spamming and abuse of such a communication channel has long been the problem with this type of communication channel. Prior to Pingbacks, WordPress used a Trackback system that provided the same type of communication.</p>\n<p>The only difference between the Trackback system and Pingbacks is that Trackbacks had to be inputted manually. Spamming problems were just as prevalent with trackbacks. In fact the WPTavern site <a href="http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death" target="_blank">shut down in 2010</a> because of trackback spam.</p>\n<p>So what makes Webmentions different than the Pingbacks and Trackbacks that came before? Well, not all that much. Turns out, Webmentions do the exact same thing as the Pingback system; they just do it better.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference between the two is the code they’re composed of. Pingback uses XMLRPC, an outdated approach that encodes data with XML and then transports that data with HTTP. The Pingback system is bulky and slow. Webmentions, on the other hand, uses HTTP and x-www-form-urlencoded content, a much more widely accepted format in today’s world. The result is that Webmentions is much faster and much easier to integrate.</p>\n<p>As Pingback’s creator Langridge <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/11/29/enabling-webmentions/" target="_blank">points out on his blog</a>, “XMLRPC is considerably less popular than it was, and is really heavyweight for this sort of thing. We’ve learned since then that HTTP can actually do all this stuff for us way more simply.” If you haven’t guessed, the Pingback founder has converted to Webmentions too.</p>\n<p>Webmention’s growing popularity is due to the tool’s ease of use and the fact that it blocks spam effectively with the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Vouch" target="_blank">Vouch protocol</a>. But Webmentions also look better aesthetically in the comments section. Pingback comments look robotic and aren’t exactly readable; a Pingback comment contains the title of the post that sent the Pingback and an ellipsed summary that doesn’t make much sense.</p>\n<p>Webmentions look and feel like human comments with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-semantic-linkbacks" target="_blank">Semantic Linkbacks plugin</a>. This plugin parses the Webmention linkback and translates it into a full sentence (e.g. ‘Sarah mentioned this post in her article x on site y’) and can even include the author’s profile picture.</p>\n<p>Webmentions are quickly replacing the Pingback system because of the tool’s convenience and better implementation to reach a similar goal, and this has been happening prior to W3C’s public endorsement. So what does W3C’s support of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention" target="_blank">IndieWebCamp’s creation</a> mean?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, W3C’s announcement will likely help cement Webmention’s place on the internet. And so W3C’s recent push can be and should be considered as an effort to standardize the wild web.</p>\n<p>The internet was created to communicate and share information, yet individual pieces of content are unable to communicate with each other as easily as users can. The Pingback system was a worthy, but flawed, attempt to change that, and now Pingback’s legacy survives through the broader support and growing distribution of Webmention’s network. If Webmentions become more popular, maybe one day in the future, they will connect the strands of the web together, so that the web will have earned its namesake in truth.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 17:40:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"WPTavern: Cory Miller and Pippin Williamson Discuss the Importance of Mental Health on Office Hours Podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52599";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:117:"http://wptavern.com/cory-miller-and-pippin-williamson-discuss-the-importance-of-mental-health-on-office-hours-podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2006:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-52604"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart.jpg?resize=1024%2C587" alt="photo credit: rubryan" class="size-full wp-image-52604" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubyran2626/2263837091/in/faves-57854010@N05/">rubryan</a>\n<p>In the latest episode of <a href="http://officehours.fm/" target="_blank">Office Hours</a>, a WordPress business podcast, host Carrie Dils interviewed <a href="https://ithemes.com/" target="_blank">Cory Miller</a> and <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/" target="_blank">Pippin Williamson</a> to discuss the importance of personal wellness.

I took the plugin for a test drive to see how easy it is to use.</p>\n<h2>A Great Introduction</h2>\n<p>Upon activation, a WPForms introduction screen is displayed. This screen provides information on how to create your first form and includes an embedded video explaining how. I had to watch the video a few times to follow along but overall it serves its purpose.</p>\n<p>If video is not your thing, consider walking through the <a href="https://wpforms.com/docs/creating-first-form/">step by step guide</a> on the WPForms website. Those who want to jump right in can do so by clicking the <strong>WPForms &gt; Add New</strong> link.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsIntroductionScreen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52581"><img class="size-full wp-image-52581" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsIntroductionScreen.png?resize=1025%2C675" alt="WP Forms Introduction Screen" /></a>WPForms Introduction Screen\n<h2>WPForm User Interface Forces You to Focus</h2>\n<p>One of the first things I noticed is the user interface and how it appears over WordPress. It was shocking at first to see WordPress disappear but the team chose to use this interface to avoid being constrained with WordPress&#8217; user interface. After working with WPForms for more than an hour, I found myself enjoying the fact that the interface forced me to focus on creating my form.</p>\n<p>WPForms ships with six different templates to handle the most common use cases. All templates except the Blank Form and the Simple Contact form require you to upgrade to the commercial version. I chose the simple contact form template.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormTemplates.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52582"><img class="size-full wp-image-52582" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormTemplates.png?resize=1025%2C559" alt="WPForm Templates" /></a>WPForm Templates\n<p>The simple contact form template automatically adds a name, email, paragraph, and submit fields to the form. An important time saver that sets WPForms apart from other plugins is that, the fields are automatically flagged as required.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSimpleContactFormTemplate.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52583"><img class="size-full wp-image-52583" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSimpleContactFormTemplate.png?resize=1025%2C605" alt="WPForm Simple Contact Form Template" /></a>WPForm Simple Contact Form Template\n<p>You can rearrange the fields by clicking and dragging them up or down. Rearranging fields is a breeze, doesn&#8217;t require a page refresh, and doesn&#8217;t bog down the browser. When clicking on a field, its properties are displayed on the left where you can configure its label, format, description, and whether or not its required.</p>\n<p>Advanced options enable you to determine a field&#8217;s size, placeholder text, default values, and whether to hide the label or sub-labels. Switching between screens and configuring fields is a fast, straightforward process.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormFieldOptions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52584"><img class="size-full wp-image-52584" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormFieldOptions.png?resize=1025%2C671" alt="WPForm Field Options" /></a>WPForm Field Options\n<p>Once the fields are configured, you&#8217;ll want to click the Settings screen. This is where you can configure what happens when a visitor clicks the submit button. You can enable or disable email notifications and use smart tags to configure the form&#8217;s output. This version of WPForms Lite doesn&#8217;t have email templates but Balkhi says it&#8217;s something the team is working on.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSmartTags.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52585"><img class="size-full wp-image-52585" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSmartTags.png?resize=1025%2C489" alt="WPForm Smart Tags" /></a>WPForm Smart Tags\n<p>Here is what the form&#8217;s output looks like in Thunderbird. Personally, I like Jetpack&#8217;s formatting style more but this could change once WPForms supports email templates.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormOutput.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52586"><img class="size-full wp-image-52586" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormOutput.png?resize=836%2C367" alt="WPForm Output" /></a>WPForms Output\n<p>As a comparison, this is what Jetpack&#8217;s Contact Form module output looks like in Thunderbird. The text looks better and I appreciate the bold field names.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/JetpacksFormOutput.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52588"><img class="size-full wp-image-52588" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/JetpacksFormOutput.png?resize=809%2C310" alt="Jetpack Contact Form Output" /></a>Jetpack Contact Form Module Output\n<p>WPForms battles spam using two different methods, honeypot and <a href="https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-captcha-wpforms/">reCAPTCHA.</a> reCAPTCHA is a free,  <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html">anti-spam service</a> provided by Google. In order to use it with WPForms, you&#8217;ll need to sign up for an account and add your site key and secret key to WPForm&#8217;s settings page.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsSettingsPage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52590"><img class="size-full wp-image-52590" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsSettingsPage.png?resize=1025%2C420" alt="WPForms Settings Page" /></a>WPForms Settings Page\n<p>Once a form is configured and saved, adding it to a page is easy. Simply create a new page in WordPress and in the editor, click the Add Form button. A modal will pop up giving you the option to choose which form to add to the page. You can also choose whether to show the form&#8217;s title and description from this box. When a form is added to the page, WPForms puts a shortcode like [ wpforms id=&#8221;50582&#8243; ] into the content area.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormInsertUI.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52592"><img class="size-full wp-image-52592" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormInsertUI.png?resize=498%2C219" alt="UI For Inserting a WPForm into a Page" /></a>UI For Inserting a WPForm into a Page\n<p>I configured WPForms to not apply styling to my form. However, you can choose whether WPForms applies base and form theme styling or base styling only. You&#8217;ll want to experiment with these options to see if your form looks any better with styles applied.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsTavernContactForm.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52593"><img class="size-full wp-image-52593" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsTavernContactForm.png?resize=696%2C881" alt="WPForms Contact Form on The Tavern Frontend" /></a>WPForms Contact Form on The Tavern Frontend\n<h2>My Verdict?</h2>\n<p>You should know that outside of creating simple contact forms and what&#8217;s available via the standard fields, almost everything else requires you to upgrade to the commercial version, including the ability to store and view form entries in WordPress. However, the plugin doesn&#8217;t nag or annoy you with popups that a commercial version is available. Upgrade prompts are only triggered when trying to access a commercial feature.</p>\n<p>After putting WPForms Lite through its paces, it&#8217;s definitely one of the easiest and fastest ways to set up a contact form. It&#8217;s clear by using the supplied templates that Balkhi and his team have considered common pitfalls and have done a great job eliminating them.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t looked into the contact form space in WordPress for a few years but after testing WPForms, I&#8217;m motivated to compare some of the most popular plugins in the space to see how each one tackles the user experience. Expect a detailed roundup in the next few weeks.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 02:05:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:123:"WPTavern: Stack Overflow Survey Results Show WordPress is Trending Up, Despite Being Ranked Among Most Dreaded Technologies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52540";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:132:"http://wptavern.com/stack-overflow-survey-results-show-wordpress-is-trending-up-despite-being-ranked-among-most-dreaded-technologies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7217:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2016.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52554"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2016.png?resize=1025%2C462" alt="stack-overflow-developer-survey-2016" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52554" /></a></p>\n<p>Stack Overflow published the results of its <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016" target="_blank">2016 Developer Survey</a>, summarizing responses from 56,033 developers in 173 countries. The 45-question survey collected answers from more than twice as many developers as the previous year.</p>\n<p>The results were published along with a disclaimer recognizing that the survey is &#8220;biased against devs who don&#8217;t speak English, or who don&#8217;t like taking English-language surveys.&#8221; Nevertheless, since the survey captured responses from such a large number of developers on a site that receives 40 million visitors per month, the results are definitely worth a read.</p>\n<p>The average age of developers surveyed was 29.6 years old and 92.8% of the respondents were male. Most of them are at least partially self-taught (69%) with 45% of them having acquired degrees in computer science or a related field.</p>\n<p>A quick developer profile of those surveyed shows that the largest section (28%) is made up of those who identify as a full-stack web developer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/developer-profile.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52557"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/developer-profile.png?resize=1025%2C490" alt="developer-profile" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52557" /></a></p>\n<h3>Developers Value Diversity</h3>\n<p>Despite the fact that the vast majority of the respondents were male, the results indicate that developers value diversity. In summarizing 42,156 responses, Stack Overflow found the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Overall, about 73% of developers tell us they think diversity is at least somewhat important in the workplace. 41% of developers say diversity is very important. And developers who most often influence hiring decisions are more likely to believe in the value of diversity than other developer types.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/diversity.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52544"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/diversity.png?resize=1025%2C481" alt="diversity" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52544" /></a></p>\n<h3>Visual Basic and WordPress Top the List for Most Dreaded Technologies</h3>\n<p>WordPress moved up one spot from last year in the ranking of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted" target="_blank">most dreaded technologies</a> that respondents would prefer not to use. This is not surprising given that the most popular tags for posts on Stack Overflow are JavaScript, Java, Android, and Python.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/most-dreaded.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52546"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/most-dreaded.png?resize=1025%2C634" alt="most-dreaded" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52546" /></a></p>\n<p>On the other hand, when surveying the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#most-popular-technologies-per-occupation" target="_blank">most popular technologies per developer type</a>, WordPress is currently used by 24.1% of front-end developers. As a side note, this also corresponds roughly to its current <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">market share</a> (26%).</p>\n<h3>WordPress and JavaScript Technologies Are Trending Up</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trending-technologies.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52548"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trending-technologies.png?resize=1025%2C842" alt="trending-technologies" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52548" /></a></p>\n<p>Newer technologies like React, Node.js, and AngularJS are trending, with the above percentages representing the change in share of Stack Overflow votes between January 2015 and January 2016. All three are also among the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-top-paying-tech" target="_blank">top-paying technologies</a> per occupation for both full stack and front-end developers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that all of these trending technologies are also becoming more readily integrated with WordPress, and will be more widely used when the REST API is finally merged with core.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that WordPress ranks second in the most dreaded technology category, it is also trending up 18.5% from 2015. According to these results, WordPress&#8217; popularity is increasing at a rate similar to that of many JavaScript-based technologies.</p>\n<h3>Job Title and Remote Work Are Important Priorities for Experienced Developers</h3>\n<p>The 2016 results found that 91% of developers surveyed worldwide are “gainfully employed” (full-time, self-employed, or freelance). Developers are in high demand, with just 15% of respondents actively looking for a job. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that 78% of developers surveyed are interested in exploring new employment opportunities.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to hire a developer, one of the most important things to consider is that they highly prioritize being able to work remotely. Responses from 49,521 developers indicate that as they gain more years of experience, both job title and remote work options are increasing priorities.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/priorities.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52549"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/priorities.png?resize=1025%2C675" alt="priorities" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52549" /></a></p>\n<p>Only 30% of developers currently work remotely part-time or full-time, but Stack Overflow found that remote developers are more likely to love their jobs than other developers. If you own a company that hires developers, chances are that you will attract a larger, more experienced pool of applicants if employees are allowed to work remotely.</p>\n<p>Developers who want to get a better understanding of the broader industry&#8217;s work challenges, salary expectations, and most popular technologies will want to review the full <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016" target="_blank">results of the survey</a>.</p>\n<p>The document includes some important feedback for the WordPress community to consider. Although WordPress is among the technologies that are trending up, the broader development community still does not seem to enjoy working with it. How can we make the software more developer-friendly without compromising user friendliness?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 21:57:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 226 – Burnout";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=52552&preview_id=52552";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-226-burnout";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2888:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the symptoms of burnout and share tips on how to prevent it.

The FBI has requested that the company hack into an iPhone recovered from one of the terrorists involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack" target="_blank">San Bernardino mass shooting</a> to assist in the criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>Apple has refused numerous court orders to create a new tool that would allow the government to circumvent the iPhone&#8217;s security measures that protect the encrypted communications of private individuals. The company will go to court on March 22nd for hearing in Riverside, CA. Fight for the Future plans to display thousands of statements in support of Apple from Internet users outside the courthouse.</p>\n<p>The Save Security campaign website summarized what is at stake with the government forcing Apple to weaken its encryption:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In its attacks on Apple, the FBI is seeking a legal precedent that would let them force any company to weaken the security of its products. Engineers use consumer products like the iPhone to maintain the most sensitive systems on the planet. Hospitals. Air traffic control. Nuclear power. What the FBI is asking for puts lives at risk, by undermining security everywhere.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Two weeks ago, Automattic <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2016/03/03/automattic-and-wordpress-com-stand-with-apple-to-support-digital-security/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it stands with Apple to support digital security. The company <a href="https://cloudup.com/iZG9vzAV3U3" target="_blank">filed an amicus brief</a> in support of Apple alongside Cloudflare, Ebay, Kickstarter, Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Square, and other leading technology companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact is that if a security flaw exists, there is no way to ensure that only trusted governments, investigating a crime, can exploit that vulnerability,&#8221; Automattic&#8217;s attorney Paul Sieminski said in the announcement. &#8220;Improving security for everyone means aggressively finding and closing holes, not creating new ones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want to join in Fight for the Future&#8217;s campaign to support Apple, the <a href="https://savesecurity.org/" target="_blank">SaveSecurity.org</a> website offers a profile picture you can use as well as a website banner (see <a href="https://savesecurity.org/?ALWAYS_SHOW_SC_BANNER=true" target="_blank">live demo</a>) to raise awareness.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 22:56:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: How to Connect Your WordPress Powered Site to Apple News Publisher";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52502";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-connect-your-wordpress-powered-site-to-apple-news-publisher";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5623:"<p>When Apple News Publisher <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/06/08Apple-Announces-News-App-for-iPhone-iPad.html">launched in September, 2015</a>, it partnered with 20 publishers including, ESPN, The New York Times, and CNN.

Note, that in order to <a href="https://help.apple.com/newspublisher/icloud/#/apdd44eeeeeb">place ads</a> in your content, you need to publish articles from a CMS like WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Is News Publisher Worth the Hassle?</h2>\n<p>As a new publisher to Apple&#8217;s syndication system, it&#8217;s too early to tell if signing up was a waste of time or a benefit to readers.

It was designed to suit creative websites, with written content and photographs receiving equal treatment.</p>\n<p>The theme is actually a fork of <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/receptar/" target="_blank">Receptar</a>, a theme by <a href="http://www.webmandesign.eu/" target="_blank">WebMan Design</a>. The original split-screen, book-like design for single posts was created to look like a modern cook book.</p>\n<p>Automattic designers added a featured content slider to the homepage along with a sticky top navigation menu, among other changes. The featured tag can be set in the customizer. If you don&#8217;t want to use the slider, the theme will default to displaying the custom header image (which is set by adding a featured image to the page assigned as the static homepage).</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52479"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-screenshot.png?resize=660%2C683" alt="dyad-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52479" /></a></p>\n<p>The homepage sports a grid layout for posts with featured images and excerpts side-by-side. Single posts display the featured image and title at 50% of of the screen with the content on the other half. The layout responds nicely for mobile devices.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-single-post-responsive.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52495"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-single-post-responsive.png?resize=660%2C391" alt="dyad-single-post-responsive" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52495" /></a></p>\n<p>Dyad includes one expandable widget area in the footer. Any widgets dropped into this area will expand to fit one, two, three, or four columns. The footer also includes space for a social links menu with icons available for 26 different social accounts.</p>\n<p>Check out a <a href="https://dyaddemo.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of Dyad on WordPress.com to see the theme in action.</p>\n<p>One consideration for using the theme is that you will always need to have large-sized feature images readily available to maintain the design. The optimal size is 1800px x 1280px. This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for photography, cooking, portfolio, or other image-heavy sites. However, if your content is more text-oriented with a few scattered images, you may want to select a different theme.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/dyad/" target="_blank">Dyad</a> is Automattic&#8217;s 87th free theme release on WordPress.org.

In the request for public comment, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/" target="_blank">White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB)</a> outlined two major goals for the new policy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This policy requires that, among other things: (1) new custom code whose development is paid for by the Federal Government be made available for reuse across Federal agencies; and (2) a portion of that new custom code be released to the public as Open Source Software (OSS).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The pilot program proposed in the draft policy would require &#8220;covered agencies to release at least 20 percent of their newly-developed custom code, in addition to the release of all custom code developed by Federal employees at covered agencies as part of their official duties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Specifically, the government is asking for feedback on a list of considerations regarding releasing custom code as open source. A few examples include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To what extent is the proposed pilot an effective means to fuel innovation, lower costs, benefit the public, and meet the operational and mission needs of covered agencies?</li>\n<li>Would a different minimum percentage be more or less effective in achieving the goals above?</li>\n<li>To what extent could this policy have an effect on the software development market? For example, could such a policy increase or decrease competition among vendors, dollar amounts bid on Federal contracts, or total life-cycle cost to the Federal Government?</li>\n<li>What opportunities and challenges exist in Government-wide adoption of an open source policy?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Encouraging developers to produce reusable code to be shared across federal agencies could significantly lower development costs and improve government efficiency. It could also promote transparency of the code quality produced by vendors and employees.</p>\n<p>After the embarrassing <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/silicon-valley-reacts-to-healthcaregov.html" target="_blank">debacle of Healthcare.gov</a>, which cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, it&#8217;s good to see government embracing open source in an expanded capacity.</p>\n<h3>How to Contribute</h3>\n<p>You can join the conversation by participating in discussions on the <a href="https://github.com/whitehouse/source-code-policy/issues" target="_blank">source code policy GitHub issues</a> or by logging a new issue. The White House even welcomes changes and line edits to the policy content via <a href="https://github.com/whitehouse/source-code-policy/edit/gh-pages/pages/index.md" target="_blank">pull requests</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/source-code-policy" target="_blank">contribute on GitHub</a> to help shape the federal source code policy until April 11, 2016. At that time public contributions will be closed and the White House will analyze feedback while creating the final policy.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 22:54:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: Shopify Launches Official Plugin for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52450";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wptavern.com/shopify-launches-official-plugin-for-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2620:"<p>Shopify <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/113145925-introducing-shopify-for-wordpress" target="_blank">announced</a> today that the company is jumping into the WordPress market with a new official plugin and three WordPress themes.

It allows users to sell products that have already been added to their Shopify stores and requires a $9/month Shopify Lite subscription.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shopify-wp.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-52463"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shopify-wp.gif?resize=975%2C549" alt="shopify-wp" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52463" /></a></p>\n<p>Shopify partnered with Themezilla, Themify, and Ultralinx to build Shopify-powered WordPress themes. The themes are only free to download for a limited time, which leaves users without updates unless they purchase the theme from the commercial provider.</p>\n<p>The corresponding plugin is currently hosted on GitHub but is in the process of being reviewed for WordPress.org, according to product representative Daniel Patricio.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many users have already been using it through the themes for a couple weeks now so we just wanted to get it out there to the rest of our users,&#8221; Patricio said. &#8220;We are in the review cycle to get it listed and should be up shortly where people will be able to get updates as we add features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is not advisable to use or install the plugin until it is hosted on WordPress.org, as Shopify currently has no way to deliver security updates to users. It is unclear why the company chose to officially launch its new WordPress integration without updates in mind, but this is a major concern. If a vulnerability were discovered, the company has no straightforward way to alert people who have downloaded the plugin from GitHub.</p>\n<p>When asked for an ETA for the plugin&#8217;s arrival on WordPress.org, Patricio said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a timeline yet but will be getting it up there soon.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 19:23:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"Matt: What’s in My Bag, 2016 edition";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46172";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/whats-in-my-bag-2016-edition/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13433:"<p>Many people have been requesting an update to <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/01/whats-in-my-bag-2014/">my what&#8217;s in my bag post from last year</a>.

It&#8217;s one of the reasons I took a month off from all things WordPress. According to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/burnout">Merriam-Webster</a>, burnout is, &#8220;the condition of someone who has become very physically and emotionally tired after doing a difficult job for a long time.&#8221; Once burnout sets in, it&#8217;s tough to recover without avoiding the job completely.</p>\n<p>Drew Jaynes, WordPress core developer, describes how contributing to the WordPress project full-time <a href="http://werdswords.com/contributing-full-time-isnt-everyone/">led to burnout</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Here’s the thing: burnout is a real struggle. And when you’re working on something full-bore, 100 percent of the time, and you burnout, there aren’t a lot of good options to help combat that except to keep pressing on and try to get your groove back,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the signs that burnout is imminent is an important step towards avoiding it, &#8220;I typically realize I’m burned out when I basically lose interest in whatever thing I’d been previously passionate about. Burnout is the result of going at something too hard for too long. And then when you stop, getting started again is a struggle,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Jaynes realized it was time to move on from full-time contributing to something new after experiencing burnout three times in seven months. Although he will continue to contribute back to WordPress, it will be in a more limited role as he focuses on products.</p>\n<h2>How Matt Mullenweg Avoids Burnout</h2>\n<p>People combat burnout differently based on their individual circumstances. When asked <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg#comment-151645">how he combats burnout</a> in an <a href="http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt">Ask Me Anything segment</a> in September 2015, Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Everything is connected, so if one of ( health | diet | relationships | family | work | soul | creative outlet ) is running on empty for too long, it will impact the others and you might end up treating the symptom rather than the cause. Recovery always comes from the people around you who give you unconditional love and support, which I&#8217;ve been lucky to have since I was an infant.</p>\n<p>To avoid it now I try to take small mini-breaks frequently, be that a ten minute meditation every day, jogging a few times a week, or taking a few days to recharge once a month. I find that&#8217;s better (and less stressful) than trying to do a big blow-out reset or vacation once a year. Conversely, a lot of times when people think I&#8217;m on vacation I&#8217;m actually working as much or more than when I&#8217;m at home, just from a more interesting location (often with fewer distractions). Funnily enough I&#8217;m more likely to actually take time off and unplug at home, and more likely to be working when in an exotic location.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I work for a company that has an unlimited vacation policy. I took advantage of it by taking a month off to clear my mind to help me refocus and it worked wonders for my mental well-being. If you feel it&#8217;s necessary and your employer has a similar policy, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for some time off to regroup. What do you do to combat burnout? Please share your advice in the comments.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 22:05:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Addicted to Distraction";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46355";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/addicted-to-distraction/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:665:"<blockquote><p>Addiction is the relentless pull to a substance or an activity that becomes so compulsive it ultimately interferes with everyday life.

In addition to translating strings, organizers are also looking to grow the translation teams and educate new translators. They have identified the following three goals for the event:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show people who are interested in translating WordPress in their language how to get involved</li>\n<li>Translate and validate the waiting strings for current projects under the supervision of the current General translation editors</li>\n<li>Add more general translation editors to different translation teams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Global Translation Day is an ambitious undertaking that involves coordinating a 24-hour live stream of tutorials about translating WordPress in different languages, as well as local, on-site contributor teams.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not very many people know how big the translation efforts around WordPress are, how dedicated our volunteer Translation Editors are to making sure we have quality, consistent software translations,&#8221; Polyglots contributor Petya Raykovska said. &#8220;We wanted the Global Translation Day to shed a bit of light on that and especially on the local teams.</p>\n<h3>Growing the WordPress Platform by Making it More Internationally Accessible</h3>\n<p>The Polyglots team is slowly chipping away at the world&#8217;s most widely spoken languages to provide core, theme, and plugin translations for users in their own languages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have many languages that need a lot of help,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;Our Japanese, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese teams are amazing, these are active 100% translated locales,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But when it comes to plugin and theme translations, that’s where the demand is greatest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other hand, we have languages that need help for WordPress core. All the Indian languages can use a huge push, our African and Asian languages need help.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The progress of each locale is tracked on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/" target="_blank">Translation Teams</a> page, displaying the percentage of strings translated for each.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/translations.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52391"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/translations.png?resize=1025%2C395" alt="translations" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52391" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Some of the biggest languages in the world are represented in this chart and if we got them to 100% that could have a huge impact on WordPress itself,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you remember the big jump WordPress did in 2011 and then in 2014, when international downloads surpassed English downloads, half of those international downloads were for Japanese,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now imagine what impact languages like Chinese, Hindi (and other Indian languages) and other languages in countries where English is not a default language, can have. The Global WordPress Translation day is about making WordPress accessible to more people and also about helping the platform’s growth,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\n<p>The Polyglots are calling all multilingual contributors to join in the event. Raykovska reports that so far they have more than 60 teams committing to take part, with 10 mini-contributor days held locally and more incoming. The Polyglots are also planning to host remote events where local teams use their own Slack channels to onboard contributors and work on translations.</p>\n<p>Contributors can choose from a number of ways to get involved. You can record a video in your language for the promotion clip, volunteer to do a live stream talk about translating WordPress into your language, organize a local contributor day, or get involved with the main organization.</p>\n<p>If you have the language skills to participate in the translation sprint, it&#8217;s one of the easiest ways to start contributing to WordPress and help prepare the platform for its next major international leap. Join #polyglots on Slack to connect with the team.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 18:11:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: Changelog Podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46350";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/changelog-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:575:"<p>I know a lot of people are on their way to SxSW right now, <a href="https://changelog.com/197/">here&#8217;s a podcast I joined called The Changelog you can download and check out on the way there</a> (or back).

This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Justin Tadlock Announces Simpler Pricing</h2>\n<p>Justin Tadlock <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/simpler-pricing-for-theme-designer-and-plugin-developer">revamped his pricing</a> model for his <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/plugin-developer">Plugin Developer</a> and <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/theme-designer">Theme Designer</a> plugins. Based on two months of feedback, Tadlock removed the pricing tiers in favor of a single price. Both plugins are $90 and come with source files, one year of support, and access to the Theme Hybrid Slack channel.</p>\n<p>Existing customers have already been upgraded and can take advantage of the new perks. What&#8217;s nice is that Tadlock is giving those who purchased the plugins for $125 a partial refund of $35 to make up the difference.</p>\n<h2>Using WordPress to Break The Silence</h2>\n<p>Mahangu Weerasinghe, who works at Automattic as a Happiness Engineer, <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/breaking-the-silence/">published a fantastic essay</a> on HeroPress this week that describes how WordPress helped him break his silence. Weerasinghe suffers from stuttering and as a result, remained silent even if he had something to say. It&#8217;s an inspirational story and the best content I&#8217;ve read all week. There are many quotable spots in the post, but this is my favorite.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are a lot of things we cannot control in this world, many forces at work that we cannot even see. But, as members of this community, I think we can content ourselves with this thought:</p>\n<p>Because of the GPL, and the way it works, WordPress will be available as a publishing platform for decades to come, and long after the next social network comes and goes, for as long as the Internet remains free and accessible, anyone with WordPress will be able to have their say.</p>\n<p>What WordPress did for me, it can do for others. And that’s why we need to keep going.</p>\n<p>Because every silence can be overcome.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Congrats Weerasinghe on defeating the silence and helping others to do the same.</p>\n<h2>Automattic Acquires Pressable</h2>\n<p>Automattic has purchased the rest of Vid Luther&#8217;s common stock shares in Pressable and has effectively <a href="https://poststatus.com/automattic-pressable/">acquired the company</a>. Chris Lauzon, a Happiness Engineer at Automattic, is the company&#8217;s interim CEO. Be sure to read Matt Mulleweng&#8217;s statement which clearly indicates to me that the company is not part of Automattic&#8217;s long-term interests.</p>\n<h2>Matt Mullenweg in The Irish Times</h2>\n<p>Ciara O&#8217;Brien <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/matt-mullenweg-how-wordpress-got-the-whole-world-blogging-1.2558828">interviewed Matt Mullenweg</a> when he visited Dublin, Ireland to speak at an Irish Software Association event. It&#8217;s one of the better interviews I&#8217;ve read in recent memory and if you know Matt well enough, you can tell which parts of the interview he showed his sense of humor.</p>\n<p>For example, when asked how he relaxes and switches off work mode, he responds &#8220;Well, this is lovely. We have tea and little cookies.” I can almost guarantee you that he chuckled while making that remark.</p>\n<h2>Introvert Reviews Pressnomics</h2>\n<p>Jeff Matson, who leads the documentation efforts for Rocketgenius, <a href="http://jeffmatson.net/realization-of-progress-and-success/">documented</a> (pun intended) his experience at Pressnomics 4. Thanks to his involvement in the community the past few years, people recognized him and started conversations with him instead of the other way around.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m the nerd with the thick glasses, overgrown beard, and a hoodie; the guy who lives in a rather small apartment, drives a Kia, and shops at outlet malls. To put it simply, I’m your typical every-day middle-class 20-something guy. Certainly not the typically targeted clientele for such a high level business-centric conference.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yet, he had a great time and strengthened relationships and created new ones with members of the community. As a friend, it&#8217;s great to see Jeff make large strides both in his professional and personal life.</p>\n<h2>Co-Organizing WordCamp Miami</h2>\n<p>David Bisset <a href="http://davidbisset.com/wordcamp-miami-2016-the-mega-review/">shares his experience</a> co-organizing one of the largest WordCamps in the US. According to a recent tweet, the team is already making plans for WordCamp Miami, FL 2017.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the reasons <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcmia?src=hash">#wcmia</a> organization team is so great: post-conference planning meetups. 2017 planning has begun. <a href="https://t.co/NZF31TRNOj">pic.twitter.com/NZF31TRNOj</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/708282526477979650">March 11, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wapuu of the North!</h2>\n<p>As a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project. St. Patrick&#8217;s day is right around the corner, so what better way to celebrate than with a Wapuu with Irish roots. Meet, The Wapuu of the North.</p>\n<p>The Wapuu of the North was created by Peter of <a href="http://1440design.com/wordpress/branding-wordcamp-belfast/" target="_blank">1440 Design</a> for WordCamp Belfast, Ireland. This particular Wapuu has quite the head of hair!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/belfast_wapuu.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-52005"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52005" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/belfast_wapuu.jpg?resize=1000%2C1000" alt="belfast_wapuu" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for issue four.

OnePress was developed by the folks at <a href="https://www.famethemes.com/themes/onepress/" target="_blank">FameThemes</a> using <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap version 4</a>. It is suitable for business, portfolio, and agency websites.</p>\n<p>The theme features a full-screen background image with action buttons in the first major section.

In a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/09/comment-changes-in-wordpress-4-5/">post on the Make Core blog</a>, Rachel Baker explains the changes and what to expect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress 4.5 includes several ancient bug fixes and a few enhancements in the Comments component. We have <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&component=Comments&milestone=4.5&group=resolution&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&col=version&order=priority">closed 25 tickets</a>,&#8221; Baker said.</p>\n<p>The biggest change users will notice are the design improvements to the comment moderation screen when clicking one of the available links in a comment moderation email. Instead of appearing as a large block of plain-text, comments are formatted as long as they contain the following HTML elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A &#8211; Links</li>\n<li>Abbr &#8211; Abbreviations</li>\n<li>Acronym &#8211; Defines an acronym</li>\n<li>B &#8211; Bold</li>\n<li>Blockquote &#8211; Specifies a section that is quoted from another source</li>\n<li>Cite &#8211; Defines the title of a work</li>\n<li>Code &#8211; Defines a piece of computer code</li>\n<li>Del &#8211; Defines text that has been deleted from a document</li>\n<li>Em &#8211; Emphasizes text</li>\n<li>I &#8211; Italicize</li>\n<li>Q &#8211; Defines a short quotation</li>\n<li>S &#8211; Specifies text that is no longer correct</li>\n<li>Strike &#8211; Defines strikethrough text</li>\n<li>Strong &#8211; Defines important text</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During testing, I noticed that in some cases, the text still appears in a large block as if the paragraph tag is ignored. I&#8217;ve already reported this issue to Baker who is looking into it. As you can see, the text that is bold, blockquoted, linked, and italicized, maintains its formatting on the moderation screen.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentFormattingOnModerationScreen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52346"><img class="size-full wp-image-52346" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentFormattingOnModerationScreen.png?resize=1025%2C571" alt="Formatted Text On The Comment Moderation Screen" /></a>Formatted Text On The Comment Moderation Screen\n<p>In addition to visual enhancements, an Edit Comment link was added to the bottom of the comment. In the future, it would be nice to edit a comment in place during the moderation flow, similar to how Quick Edit works, instead of navigating to a different screen. Other notable changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated message styles that match other screens.</li>\n<li>The comment date is only wrapped in a link if the comment permalink exists.</li>\n<li><code>#wpbody-content</code> is appended to comment moderation email links for accessibility.</li>\n<li>The <code>rel=nofollow</code> attribute and value pair will no longer be added to relative or same domain links within <code>comment_content</code>.</li>\n<li><code>WP_Comment_Query</code> now supports the <code>author_url</code> parameter.</li>\n<li>The new <code>pre_wp_update_comment_count_now</code> filter allows you to bail out of updating the comment count for a given Post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Maximum Comment Field Length</h2>\n<p>Those who publish lengthy comments will be happy to know that in WordPress 4.5, &#8220;the comment fields will enforce the maximum length of each field’s respective database column with hardcoded attributes. The hardcoded limits can be adjusted to accommodate custom database schemas using the <code>comment_form_default_fields</code> filter,&#8221; Baker said. By default, the limits are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comment: 65525 characters</li>\n<li>Name : 245 characters</li>\n<li>Email: 100 characters</li>\n<li>Url: 200 characters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When comments are submitted in 4.5, they&#8217;ll be checked by the new <code>wp_get_comment_fields_max_lengths()</code> function and the <code>wp_get_comment_fields_max_lengths</code> filter. If a value is more than the limit, a <code>WP_Error</code> is displayed. If a user publishes a comment and sees an error page, they&#8217;ll be able to navigate back to their comment via a link rather than having to use their browser&#8217;s back button.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentErrorNavigation.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52347"><img class="size-full wp-image-52347" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentErrorNavigation.png?resize=724%2C354" alt="Comment Error Page Navigation" /></a>Comment Error Page Navigation\n<p>It&#8217;s great that comments continue to receive attention, even if there&#8217;s a long way to go. Unfortunately, the ability to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717">send a notification email when a comment is approved from moderation</a> was punted to a future release. I&#8217;m looking forward to reviewing plugins that allow users to easily configure the comment length limits as seen above. It would be nice to configure the limits so spammers see an error message because of their comment&#8217;s length rather than being placed into the moderation queue.</p>\n<p>To see and test these improvements yourself, download and install <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/03/wordpress-4-5-beta-3/">WordPress beta 3</a> on a test site.

GitHub officially apologized for the lack of communication and promised to add new features and iterate on the core experience.</p>\n<p>Shortly after acknowledging the letter, GitHub <a href="http://wptavern.com/github-introduces-issue-and-pull-request-templates" target="_blank">introduced templates for issues and pull requests</a>, which allow project maintainers to guide contributors towards submitting more meaningful contributions.</p>\n<p>One of the other major requests included in the open letter was a voting system to declutter +1&#8217;s from issues. While the +1&#8217;s constitute valuable feedback, maintainers need a better UI to help make these conversations easier to read.</p>\n<p>GitHub has now answered this request by <a href="https://github.com/blog/2119-pull-request-and-issue-reactions" target="_blank">adding emoji reactions to pull requests, issues, and comments</a>. Emoji support is nothing new but organizing it into reactions helps keep comments more manageable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In many cases, especially on popular projects, the result is a long thread full of emoji and not much content, which makes it difficult to have a discussion. With reactions, you can now reduce the noise in these threads.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reactions are currently limited to six emoji that are commonly used in GitHub conversations:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-reactions.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-52312"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-reactions.gif?resize=917%2C359" alt="github-reactions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52312" /></a></p>\n<p>Going forward, emoji reactions should make life easier for project maintainers, as they provide a quick way to assess consensus. If contributors embrace emoji reactions, the new feature can help maintainers gauge how widespread a bug is. They also serve to highlight the most helpful comments in a conversation.</p>\n<p>Emoji reactions, which were also recently adopted by Slack and Facebook, are making their way into more applications as an alternative way of offering feedback. Path was one of the first social apps to offer reactions in 2012. Buzzfeed has taken the feature to a new level with the addition of gif reaction options at the end of articles:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/buzzfeed-reactions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52327"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/buzzfeed-reactions.png?resize=1025%2C601" alt="buzzfeed-reactions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52327" /></a></p>\n<p>A feature that was once limited to social networks is now changing communication in the workplace by facilitating conversations for large groups of people. While emoji reactions offer people more ways of expressing themselves, they can also serve as a metric, a gauge, and a voting system.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-feature-plugin-for-wordpress-adds-emoji-reactions-to-posts" target="_blank">Reactions feature plugin</a> for WordPress received no small amount of criticism when it was introduced earlier this week. Even if the plugin never reaches the proposal stage, the conversation about the value of emoji reactions in modern communication is worth having.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 16:10:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Matt: From Silence to Publishing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46343";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/from-silence-to-publishing/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:722:"<blockquote><p>My parents first noticed my stutter when I was three years old.

They were first known as ZippyKid, and <a href="https://poststatus.com/zippykid-pressable/">rebranded in 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>Automattic was already a shareholder in Pressable, most recently as the primary investor of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pressable#/entity">a $1.5 million round</a> in April of 2015.</p>\n<p>Technically, Automattic purchased  common stock shares from Vid Luther, the CEO of Pressable. The monetary value of that common stock was, &#8220;enough to be debt free,&#8221; according to Vid. He owned about 37% of the company, or 4.5 million shares of 7 million shares of common stock (versus preferred shares). The company has also been in debt, reportedly close to $1 million worth.</p>\n<p>Automattic is now the majority owner of Pressable, and since Vid sold his shares, this is effectively an acquisition, and Automattic will be able to set the direction of the company from now on. Chris Lauzon, a Happiness Engineer at Automattic, is the interim CEO. There are other smaller investors in Pressable whom maintain their shares in the company, and it&#8217;s unknown what those investors will do.</p>\n<p>When I confirmed the exit with Vid, he said, &#8220;This is the best thing that I could have done for my family, or myself.&#8221; He was burning the candle at both ends, working twice as much as he wanted to be working, and wasn&#8217;t seeing the growth and success that he dreamed of for so many years. Pressable has always done okay in the managed WordPress market, but never outpaced quick-growth and heavily funded WP Engine, or the first entry to the market, Pagely. But Pressable has not been in a position of strength for a really long time.</p>\n<p>Pagely, WP Engine, and Pressable were really the first three into the market of managed hosting &#8212; a market that now includes nearly every big name host. It&#8217;s fascinating to see the different directions they&#8217;ve gone since. WP Engine <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wp-engine#/entity">has raised</a> nearly $40 million over the years and gone for scale (Automattic also invested in their Series A), while Pagely has bootstrapped the whole way and really hit their stride in the last couple of years with a move to the higher end of the market. Dozens of managed hosting companies exist today.</p>\n<p>The work these three companies put into the early managed market got the attention of the biggest players in the market, like GoDaddy and EIG (owner of BlueHost, HostGator, and many more). Pressable fought hard, and Vid&#8217;s exit from the company comes after a long road with many challenges.</p>\n<p>Pressable has long been on Rackspace infrastructure, as Vid had relationships with them going back a long time; that infrastructure suffered <a href="http://wptavern.com/recent-pressable-outages-the-result-of-a-slow-loris-attack">a few catastrophic outages</a> from attacks that cost Pressable quite a few customers in January 2015, stunting progress.</p>\n<p>They nearly sold Pressable to WP Engine about two years ago, and decided against it at the 11th hour. The financing round last year was a period of rejuvenation for them, after a troubled period between the malicious attacks on their infrastructure and some internal issues, and the team was looking forward to new opportunities moving forward, including a potential focus on hosting catered for eCommerce with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Speaking to an agency owner with clients at Pressable, they told me they believe they, &#8220;always struggled to find their voice and audience in a space that quickly filled up.&#8221; I agree with the observation.</p>\n<p>Pressable&#8217;s revenues were under $2 million per year, and they have a team of about 10 people. Vid is no longer at the company; his last day was March 7th. It remains to be seen exactly what direction Automattic will take the company, though I presume it will continue business as usual for now, like they did <a href="https://poststatus.com/automattic-acquired-woocommerce-woothemes/">after the WooThemes acquisition</a>. While Automattic now owns the company, Matt Mullenweg made it clear to me that it&#8217;s not in their long term interest to be significantly involved in the traditional hosting business.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg gave the following statement about the purchase:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic is happy to be an investor in a number of WordPress-related companies and web hosts, and will continue to invest in the future. With Pressable we&#8217;ve unfortunately been forced to take a more active role to protect Pressable&#8217;s customers, employees, and our investment. Chris Lauzon, a Happiness Engineer at Automattic, has been temporarily working with the Pressable team to get everything in order, especially on the support side. Automattic continues to enjoy working with and supporting many great WordPress hosts, and we expect that Pressable will be able to operate fully independently in the future.</p></blockquote>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 21:59:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: Do the Woo: A New Podcast for WooCommerce Store Owners";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52197";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wptavern.com/do-the-woo-a-new-podcast-for-woocommerce-store-owners";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3266:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/podcast.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-52297"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/podcast.jpg?resize=960%2C472" alt="photo credit: Maciej Korsan" class="size-full wp-image-52297" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/IQVHQYS3GL">Maciej Korsan</a>\n<p>Bob Dunn, a WordPress educator better known on the web as <a href="https://bobwp.com/" target="_blank">BobWP</a>, is <a href="http://dothewoopodcast.com/welcome-to-do-the-woo-the-podcast-for-woocommerce-shop-owners/" target="_blank">launching a podcast for WooCommerce store owners</a>. &#8220;Do the Woo&#8221; will air weekly on Wednesdays with tips and tricks to help store owners attract more customers. Dunn plans to host guests involved in WooCommerce development, as well as store owners who will be invited to share their challenges and successes.</p>\n<p>After using WooCommerce for five years with client projects, as well as his own products, Dunn is prepared to share his store management experience with listeners. He&#8217;s used the plugin and many of its extensions for selling services, bookings, downloads, and currently for his membership site sales. He has also taught WooCommerce workshops and is preparing new courses for his students.</p>\n<p>Store owners are the targeted audience for Dunn&#8217;s new podcast with a focus on the business aspects of store management.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be a mix of topics, rather than a straight interviews format, which is what many of the other podcasts are,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I’ll be sharing eCommerce news and tips from a WooCommerce perspective. I’ll Interview Woo experts, designers, developers and shop owners. I’ll also share ideas for using Woo in ways that the average user might not have considered.

Although 3.9.3 is billed as a &#8220;maintenance and compatibility release,&#8221; there are a number of significant changes and improvements that make this an important release.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.5 will introduce native <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-5-to-introduce-native-support-for-a-theme-logo" target="_blank">support for a theme logo</a>. This will render Jetpack&#8217;s site logo feature obsolete. The 3.9.3 release of the plugin adds compatibility with WordPress 4.5 by ensuring that sites use core&#8217;s implementation for custom logos instead.</p>\n<p>According to Konstantin Obenland in a recent <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/10/custom-logo/" target="_blank">post</a> on make/core, &#8220;Jetpack will do a migration behind the scenes to work with it out of the box.&#8221; He also said that WordPress core&#8217;s new custom logo feature will use <a href="http://wptavern.com/customizer-responsive-preview-and-selective-refresh-to-be-merged-into-wordpress-4-5" target="_blank">Selective Refresh</a>, which means that the preview will load instantly after the image has been uploaded.</p>\n<p>Notable enhancements in this release include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When using Carousel and Photon together, Jetpack will now link to the Photon version of full-sized images</li>\n<li>Performance improvements to Comments, Infinite Scroll, Markdown, Publicize, Sitemaps, and the Subscription widget</li>\n<li>Infinite Scroll: Introduced a later filter for settings</li>\n<li>New filters in the Top Posts Widget code</li>\n<li>oEmbed for Houzz.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The release also fixes an annoying bug in the Comments module that would reload the page when clicking &#8216;Reply.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Jetpack 3.9.4 was released right on the heels of 3.9.3 to fix an issue where some comments were being displayed incorrectly. The problem was significant enough to push out an additional release right away.</p>\n<p>Updating to the latest version of Jetpack will help your site work seamlessly with WordPress 4.5 when it is released the week of April 12.

The event, which will be held in Vienna June 24-26, has expanded its capacity to 2200 attendees (including micro-sponsors.) 400 additional tickets will be made available this week.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2016-sold-out-organizers-working-to-get-more-venue-space" target="_blank">The first 1700 seats sold out</a> six months in advance, causing organizers to scramble to expand the venue capacity to meet the overwhelming demand for more tickets. They were able to secure three additional halls in the Leopold Museum and the Baroque suites of the MuseumsQuartier, all located within a minute&#8217;s walking distance of each other.</p>\n<p>“With the camp happening in the city center, we wanted to make it easy for people to visit all the exquisite museums and sights in the area,&#8221; lead organizer Petya Raykovska said. As a bonus, conference goers will receive free access to the Leopold&#8217;s museum&#8217;s permanent exhibitions as part of their tickets.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe will also be hosting the largest WordPress contributor day on record. Organizers are planning for 500 attendees and are considering using one of Vienna&#8217;s universities as the venue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We would have liked it to be in Leopold’s but unfortunately securing stable wifi for so many people in a museum is above our budget, so we’re looking for a venue that already has the infrastructure,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\n<p>Current attendees represent 68 different countries, and the organizing team now includes members from 10 countries spanning both Eastern and Western Europe. The team would like to host a WordPress community summit for Europe but have not received confirmation for this year.</p>\n<p>The host city for WordCamp Europe 2017 will be selected by the end of March. This will expand the organizing team for the current event, as future hosts will come on board to learn the ropes.</p>\n<p>The next batch of <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/tickets/" target="_blank">tickets</a> for the event will go on sale Friday, March 11th at 10 AM CET. In the meantime, the 250 people who signed up for the <a href="http://eepurl.com/bNsAUr" target="_blank">waiting list</a> will receive an email to claim their tickets first via a special reservation link.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 10:35:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: Write CSS in the Customizer with the Advanced CSS Editor Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52194";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wptavern.com/write-css-in-the-customizer-with-the-advanced-css-editor-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3247:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/paint-brush.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-52240"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/paint-brush.jpg?resize=1024%2C538" alt="photo credit: cutting in - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-52240" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10687935@N04/6021868900">cutting in</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Last year WordPress developer <a href="http://www.hardeepasrani.com/" target="_blank">Hardeep Asrani</a> and the folks at <a href="http://themeisle.com/" target="_blank">ThemeIsle</a> released <a href="http://wptavern.com/customize-your-login-page-using-the-wordpress-customizer" target="_blank">Custom Login Customizer</a>, a plugin that allows users to design their own login pages in the customizer. Since that time core developers have made more progress on the customizer roadmap, allowing for more varied uses outside of a theme-related context.</p>\n<p>Last week the ThemeIsle team debuted <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-css-editor/" target="_blank">Advanced CSS Editor</a>, a new plugin in its arsenal that demonstrates another exciting use for the customizer. It makes use of <a href="http://wptavern.com/customizer-responsive-preview-and-selective-refresh-to-be-merged-into-wordpress-4-5" target="_blank">postMessage transport</a> to offer live previews of CSS changes while a user is writing them in the customizer. The plugin also allows users to write CSS for different device screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile phones. The demo below shows a screen capture of the plugin in action on my test site:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/edit-css.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-52205"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/edit-css.gif?resize=924%2C558" alt="edit-css" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52205" /></a></p>\n<p>Seeing CSS edits updating in real time, instead of switching back and forth between a file editor and the frontend, was a refreshing experience. Having the ability to quickly write and preview media queries is also a convenient feature.</p>\n<p>Although many core contributors are not fond of having a file editor in WordPress, the feature has yet to be removed. Using the Advanced CSS Editor plugin makes you wonder what the core file editor might look like in the customizer, at least for CSS files.</p>\n<p>In the past, the customizer&#8217;s paint brush admin icon seemed like an ambitious stretch for a feature that, up until recently, felt clunky and slow to render previews. But recent advancements like <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/" target="_blank">selective refresh</a> will help to make the customizer provide a true live preview experience.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-css-editor/" target="_blank">Advanced CSS Editor</a> plugin is a good example of how fast previews can be in the customizer and how much of a better experience it offers over similar plugins that require multiple clicks to refresh.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Mar 2016 23:13:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: Jetpack Turns 5 and Celebrates With a New Domain";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52190";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-turns-5-and-celebrates-with-a-new-domain";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9574:"<p>On this day in 2011, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a>, the project formerly known as &#8220;.org connect&#8221; inside Automattic, was released to the public.

According to domain appraisal service <a href="http://www.estibot.com">Estibot.com</a>, its <a href="http://www.estibot.com/appraise.php?a=appraisal&k=f818b525ed659fb84fdca10f05e64f47&domain=jetpack.com">estimated value</a> is $51K.</p>\n<h2>Interview With Jesse Friedman</h2>\n<p>Friedman describes his journey working on Jetpack and shares what he&#8217;s learned since joining the team.</p>\n<p><strong>How long have you been on the Jetpack journey and what&#8217;s it been like?</strong></p>\n<p>I started using Jetpack in the Spring of 2012. I was working as the Director of Web Development at a web development and marketing company. I needed several different tools to round out the WordPress environment I was building to house a 2,000 site multisite that was growing by 50 sites a month.</p>\n<p>All of us on the team agreed that Jetpack solved a lot of different needs for us in one convenient plugin. As developers, we loved the out of the box features like Sharing, Publicize, and Monitor, and our clients loved Stats.</p>\n<p>In 2014, I left that company and joined up with the BruteProtect team. We worked hard to build a great security plugin that has been implemented on millions of websites. Later in 2014, we were excited to receive the news that we were joining the Jetpack team to continue BruteProtect as a Jetpack feature. Released last year, Jetpack Protect guards our users from malicious and brute force login attempts. It was truly something special to go from being a big fan of Jetpack to being on the team at Automattic.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some things you have learned through Jetpack development that have benefited you in other areas?</strong></p>\n<p>In the last 18 months, I’ve been doing a lot of work around the experience users have with Jetpack. Everything from individual features, to the connection process, to our website and how we communicate with our users. I’ve learned a lot about Jetpack and our community. The main thing being that, while Jetpack provides a lot of value to professionals and veterans, it is just<span class="copyonly"> as</span><i></i>, if not more important for new users.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think Jetpack is a key component to WordPress reaching 50% market share?</strong></p>\n<p>The WordPress community as a whole is growing so quickly. Hosts provide really simple tools to build a WordPress website with a single click or even no clicks at all. That means that WordPress and Jetpack have to be just as intuitive and work to improve the new user experience.<i class="copy_only"></i></p>\n<p>This is especially important when we consider growing WordPress&#8217; market share. I think everyone who builds something for WordPress, or publishes on WordPress, or organizes WordPress community events, are critical to growing to 50% or beyond.</p>\n<p>Any WordPress tool or plugin that can help a user build their website faster while providing maintenance tools like Manage or security tools like Protect is going to play an important role in the growth of market share.</p>\n<p>Jetpack specifically, is in a unique position because we can leverage the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WordPress.com</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>infrastructure and network to build extremely powerful tools (like a global CDN) in an otherwise simple interface. Not to mention Jetpack’s popularity, it’s one of the most popular plugins across all of WordPress. Which is reinforced for me as I spend more and more time with our users, who are quite happy.</p>\n<h2>Paid Services in Jetpack Remain at a Minimum</h2>\n<p>Jetpack has come a long way since its inception but it&#8217;s interesting to look back at 2011 and review what some in the WordPress media world had to say about it. Ryan Imel, of WPCandy.com, <a href="http://wpcandy.com/thinks/jetpack-means-more-than-features-for-dot-org-users/">looked into new opportunities for Automattic</a> as Jetpack provided a direct line into millions of self hosted sites.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jetpack is now a direct line in to WordPress.org Dashboards for Automattic. When (not <em>if</em>) Automattic releases a new software as a service, a simple update to Jetpack will bring that news in front of a serious number of WordPress.org users. This is a big step for Automattic, since up to now their reach has been mostly within the walls of WordPress.com. Now Jetpack is not only available for anyone to use, but it will come preinstalled with one-click installs of WordPress with a number of hosting providers.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://jetpack.com/2011/03/09/blast-off/">Jetpack&#8217;s goal</a> was to provide many of the useful features on WordPress.com to self-hosted users and while it does that, the business portion of the plugin can&#8217;t be ignored. Automattic owned services VideoPress and VaultPress are presented to millions of users who may otherwise not have known about them.</p>\n<p>Today, Jetpack contains only two modules that require a paid subscription, VideoPress and VaultPress. So while it would be easy to increase Jetpack&#8217;s revenue generating capabilities by cramming it with commercial services and paid add-ons, Automattic has not done so.</p>\n<p>At the end of the post, Imel asks a question that couldn&#8217;t be answered at the time, &#8220;In a large sense, what does Jetpack mean to the world of WordPress?&#8221; Fast forward five years later, we know that it&#8217;s a key component that&#8217;s helping <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share">WordPress move towards 50% market share</a>.</p>\n<h2>Jetpack Pride</h2>\n<p>The five year mark is a great milestone for any plugin and a great time to reflect. In Jetpack&#8217;s five year existence, Matt Mullenweg, WordPress co-founder, says what he&#8217;s most proud of, &#8220;I’m most proud of the fact that people who start using WordPress and Jetpack at the same time are more likely to be using WordPress a month later. It brings us closer to WordPress’ over-arching goal of democratizing publishing, giving users the ability to have the best of both worlds: open source and cloud.&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<h2>Share Your Jetpack Story</h2>\n<p>The Jetpack team is looking for feedback on how it&#8217;s saved you time, help you build websites faster, helped optimize your sites, etc. You can share your story by publishing it in the comments of this post or by using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JetpackTurns5&src=typd"><strong>#JetpackTurns5</strong></a> hashtag on Twitter. One of my favorite stories so far is from Cécile Rainon who discovered WordPress through Jetpack and now works for Automattic.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Discovered WordPress through this plugin and I''m now a proud Automattician! <a href="https://t.co/r0yCKYzqmI">https://t.co/r0yCKYzqmI</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/jetpack">@jetpack</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jetpackturns5?src=hash">#jetpackturns5</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Cécile (@cecile_rainon) <a href="https://twitter.com/cecile_rainon/status/707594514433753088">March 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>We use a number of modules to provide basic functionality such as contact forms, custom CSS, Likes, Protect, and more. In fact, every module except for five are activated on the Tavern. Using one plugin that handles a lot of the functionality we use on a daily basis is easier to maintain than using a number of separate plugins.</p>\n<p>Happy birthday, Jetpack and here&#8217;s to five more!</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Mar 2016 22:02:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"Matt: Jetpack Turns 5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46331";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/jetpack-turns-5/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:761:"<p>Today the <a href="http://jetpack.com/2016/03/09/5-years-in-jetpack-is-soaring-higher-than-ever/">Jetpack plugin turns five years old</a>.

The modal also expands to let you search for and link to existing content.</p>\n<p>The TinyMCE link modal in WordPress 4.5 will allow for inline editing. It can actually detect when a user is entering a URL or attempting to search for one. The search uses jQuery UI Autocomplete, making it fast and easy to search through existing content.
